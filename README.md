# prime-number-generator
The program has a pretty cool algorithm that determines prime numbers. The user will be asked to input a number from any positive range, (haven't tried any enormous values to find the primes but try at your own risk, I'm sure it would crash at some point) and calculate all the primes up to that range. It will also print out 'N' number of primes from the entered value.
